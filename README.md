* **Easy service invocation:** The Chime TTS service can be used in automations, scripts, and other Home Assistant components.

* **Set media player notification volume:** Set the volume of the media player for the notification, and restore it back once completed.

3. Scroll to the bottom and select `CREATE TOKEN` under the 'Long-Lived Access Tokens' section.
4. Enter a name (eg: *Chime TTS*) and copy the token string
5. Go to Home Assistant's `Settings` -> `Devices and Services` -> `Add Integration`, and type: *Chime TTS* (if it does not appear empty your browser cache and reload the page).
6. Paste in your token and click `Submit`.
