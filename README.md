Chime TTS is a custom Home Assistant integration that eliminates the audio lag between playing a chime/notification sound effect before a TTS audio notification.

## What is Chime TTS?

### The Problem:

<source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nimroddolev/chime_tts/main/images/wiki/home/no_chime_tts-dark.png">
<source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nimroddolev/chime_tts/main/images/wiki/home/no_chime_tts-light.png">
<img alt="Latency is introduced between the notification chime and the TTS audio" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nimroddolev/chime_tts/main/images/wiki/home/no_chime_tts-dark.png">

Home Assistant's Text-To-Speech (TTS) audio messages are a great way to provide real-time updates, but by the time you hear a message playing you've missed the start of the message! ðŸ™ˆ

Adding a notification chime before the TTS makes sense, but in practice this introduces a delay between the two caused by the networking latency of cloud TTS platforms, audio processing, and a delay before playback begins on speakers.

### The Solution:

**Chime TTS** solves this issue by stitching these audio files together as _a single file_ locally on your Home Assistant device, and played to your speakers in a single event, eliminating any lag.

##  Features

Chime TTS offers various features that enhance TTS audio playback experience:

- **No lag or timing issues:** Precise timing between audio files without cloud TTS delays.
- **Customizable audio cues:** Play preset or custom audio before and after TTS messages.
- **Flexible TTS platform selection:** Supports various [TTS platform integrations](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/#text-to-speech).
- **Easy service invocation:** Use the 'chime_tts.say' service in automations and scripts.
- **Set media player notification volume:** Restore volume after playback.
- **Configurable TTS playback speed:** Set the TTS audio speed anywhere from 100-200%.

## How Do I Use It?

Chime TTS adds three new services to your Home Assistant instance: `chime_tts.say`, `chime_tts.say_url` and `chime_tts.clear_cache`. Discover how you can use these services and the features they offer:

- [chime_tts.say](https://github.com/nimroddolev/chime_tts/wiki/chime_tts.say): Play audio and TTS messages with various settings.
- [chime_tts.say_url](https://github.com/nimroddolev/chime_tts/wiki/chime_tts.say_url): Generates a publicly accessible URL to the MP3 file generated by `chime_tts.say`.
- [chime_tts.clear_cache](https://github.com/nimroddolev/chime_tts/wiki/chime_tts.clear_cache): Clear generated audio cache.

You can customise the following elements for the `chime_tts.say` and `chime_tts.say_url` services:

| Config Option          | Description                                                                                                                | Default Value                                    |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Timeout**             | Set the maximum number of seconds before the service call is terminated (useful if you have long TTS messages and don't want the service end prematurely) | `60`            |
| **Media Folder**        | Media Folder - Media folder for storing temporary files.                                                                      | `local`                                            |
| **Temporary MP3 Folder**| Temporary MP3 Folder - Path to the local folder where the generated mp3 files are saved.                                   | `/media/sounds/temp/chime_tts/`                 |
| **Public MP3 Folder**   | Public MP3 Folder - Path to the publicly accessible folder used to store MP3 files generated by `chime_tts.say_url` service. | `/www/chime_tts/`     
| **Custom Chimes**       | Add the full file paths to your own custom chime audio files. Once added, you can select your custom chimes form the drop-down list UI in the `chime_tts.say` and `chime_tts.say_url` services. | None |
