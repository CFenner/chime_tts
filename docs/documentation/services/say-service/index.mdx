# `chime_tts.say` Service

The `chime_tts.say` service joins together audio files (*"chimes"*) and TTS audio as a new MP3 file, locally, for playback on `media_player` target/s.

---

## Service Calls

Each service call is run synchronously so that any additional calls in the automation/script are delayed until the notification has finished playback.

If additional calls are made before the current call is finished, it is added to a queue and run once the current service call has completed.

---

## Parameters
The [parameters](./parameters) page provides explanations for each parameter supported by Chime TTS

---

## Examples
The [examples](./examples) page demonstates the full scope of what's possible with Chime TTS.
- See [basic](./examples#basic-tts-audio) notification examples cover simple calls
- See [complex](./examples#more-complex-examples) notifications which involve adjusting audio properties
- See [message segments](./examples#message-segments), used for messages with multiple chimes and TTS, and offers more options.

## TTS Platforms

:::info[BYO TTS Platforms]

Chime TTS is not a TTS platform. It utilizes **[TTS integrations](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/#text-to-speech)** installed to your Home Assistant instance.

Any TTS platform you wish to use _**must be configured separately.**_

:::

### TTS Platform-Specific Options
Each TTS platform offers its own set of options, which can also be used with Chime TTS in the `options` parameter. Several key TTS platform parameters exist as separate parameters in Chime TTS (*see* `chime_tts.say`*'s [additional parameters](./parameters#additional-parameters) documentation for more*).

## Selecting Chimes

Chimes are audio files that can be incorporated into notifications. You can find the preset chimes that ship with Chime TTS [here](https://github.com/nimroddolev/chime_tts/tree/main/custom_components/chime_tts/mp3s).

You can add chimes to your notifications in different places:
- **Before** TTS audio *(using the* [`chime_path`](./parameters#chime_path) *parameter).*
- **After** TTS audio *(using the* [`end_chime_path`](./parameters#end_chime_path) *parameter)*, and
- **Between** TTS audio segments *(using* [`message`](./parameters#advanced-usage-segment-sequences) *segments).*

There are 3 ways you can define which chime/s to include in your notification:

### 1. Selecting chimes from the user-interface

Use the drop-down chime list in the UI to set a preset chime sound effect:

### 2. Custom local audio files and external URLs

You can specify both local file paths or external URLs to your own audio files.

* #### Local Files
  You can specify absolute local file paths to audio files in your Home Assistant instance's media folder, or any other folder.

  <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/say/chime_path.png')} />


* #### External audio file URLs
  You can also specify URLs to audio files hosted online, which will be downloaded and optionally saved locally them to your [Downloaded Chimes Folder](../../configuration) when the [`cache`](../say-service/parameters#cache) property is set to `true`.

  <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/say/external_chime_path.png')} />


### 3. Custom chime slots for the chime list UI
You can set up to 5 custom chime slots which appear at the end of the drop-down list in the UI, allowing you to easily select your custom chimes when creating automations.
To configure the custom chime slots, open the [Chime TTS configuration page](../../configuration) and enter the full file path to your local custom audio file, or the URL to an audio file hosted online.

The configuration page is located at:

`Settings` --> `Devices & services` --> `Chime TTS` --> `CONFIGURE`

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/say/configuration.png')} />

Once added, you can use your custom chimes by selecting them from the chime list UI:

## Alexa Smart speakers
Chime TTS suppors Alexa smart speakers through the [Alexa Media Player](https://github.com/alandtse/alexa_media_player) integration. Playback on Alexa media_players will require this integration.
