# Sending Notifications

See the below example for how to send Chime TTS notifications:

### Basic example
```
  service: notify.reminder
  data:
    message: "Don't forget to pick up the kids!"
```

### Example with parameter overrides
In the below example, the [`chime_path`](../services/say-service/parameters#chime_path) and [`volume_level`](../services/say-service/parameters#volume_level) values defined in the `reminder` notify entry are overridden with custom values:
```
  service: notify.reminder
  data:
    message: "Don't forget to pick up the kids!"
    data:
      chime_path: /media/sounds/chimes/urgent.mp3
      volume_level: 1.0
```
