# `chime_tts.say` Service

The `chime_tts.say` service joins together audio files, or *"chimes"*, and TTS audio, and then streams it to `media_player` target/s.

## TTS Platforms

Chime TTS utilizes [TTS Platforms](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/#text-to-speech) that have been added to your Home Assistant instance, and is not a TTS platform itself. Any TTS platform you wish to use will need to be configured separately.

### TTS Platform-Specific Options
Each TTS platform offers its own set of options, which can also be used with Chime TTS in the `options` parameter. Several key TTS platform parameters exist as separate parameters in Chime TTS (*see* `chime_tts.say`*'s [additional parameters](../say-service/parameters#additional-parameters) documentation for more*).

## Selecting Chimes

Chimes are audio files that can be incorporated into notifications. You can find the preset chimes that ship with Chime TTS [here](https://github.com/nimroddolev/chime_tts/tree/main/custom_components/chime_tts/mp3s).

You can add chimes to your notifications in different places:
- **Before** TTS audio *(using the* [`chime_path`](../say-service/parameters#chime_path) *parameter).*
- **After** TTS audio *(using the* [`end_chime_path`](../say-service/parameters#end_chime_path) *parameter)*, and
- **Between** TTS audio segments *(using* [`message`](../say-service/parameters#advanced-usage-segment-sequences) *segments).*

There are 3 ways you can define which chime/s to include in your notification:

### 1. Selecting chimes from the user-interface
Use the drop-down chime list in the UI to set a preset chime sound effect:

### 2. Custom local audio files and external URLs

You can specify both local file paths or external URLs to your own audio files.

* #### Local Files
  You can specify absolute local file paths to audio files in your Home Assistant instance's media folder, or any other folder.

  ![chime_path](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nimroddolev/chime_tts/main/images/wiki/chimes/chime_path.png)

* #### External audio file URLs
  You can also specify URLs to audio files hosted online, which will be downloaded and optionally saved locally them to your [Downloaded Chimes Folder](../../quick-start/configuration) when the [`cache`](../say-service/parameters#cache) property is set to `true`.

  ![external_chime_path](https://github.com/nimroddolev/chime_tts/assets/1849295/91adf68c-f77d-4c45-b341-93e392792e31)

### 3. Custom chime slots for the chime list UI
You can set up to 5 custom chime slots which appear at the end of the drop-down list in the UI, allowing you to easily select your custom chimes when creating automations.
To configure the custom chime slots, open the [Chime TTS configuration page](../../quick-start/configuration) and enter the full file path to your local custom audio file, or the URL to an audio file hosted online.

The configuration page is located at:

`Settings` --> `Devices & services` --> `Chime TTS` --> `CONFIGURE`

![configuration](https://github.com/nimroddolev/chime_tts/assets/1849295/c0e186a2-5fc5-4b0c-9eb8-7089bcec6721)

Once added, you can use your custom chimes by selecting them from the chime list UI:
