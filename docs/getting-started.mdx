## What is Chime TTS?

### The Problem:

<div id='problemDiv'>
    <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/the_problem.png')} />
    <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/travolta.gif')} class='travolta' />
</div>

Home Assistant's Text-To-Speech (TTS) audio messages are a great way to provide real-time updates, but by the time you hear a message playing you've missed the start of the message! ðŸ™ˆ

Adding a notification chime before the TTS makes sense, but in practice this introduces a delay between the two caused by the networking latency of cloud TTS platforms, audio processing, and a delay before playback begins on speakers.

### The Solution:

![with_chime_tts-dark](https://github.com/nimroddolev/chime_tts/assets/1849295/54ec4f20-7eaf-4180-b159-4feb4afc334a)


**Chime TTS** solves this issue by stitching these audio files together as _a single file_ locally on your Home Assistant device, and played to your speakers in a single event, eliminating any lag.
